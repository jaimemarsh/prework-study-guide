        <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
        <li>HTML is made up of elements, some examples of elements include text, image, header, and list elements. Other
          elements are used to divid a page such as meta-related, content divsion, and semantic.</li>
        <li>Html is like a frame for a house, it must be strong and set up first to build a good foundation for how it will
          later look and work (interaction).</li>
        <li>Elements are represents with angle brakets (&lt; , &gt;) called tags.</li>
        <li>The head element contains metadata which helps the browser render the page correctly. This is not visibile
          to the user.</li>
        <li>The body element contains the content for the user, everything you want the user to see or interact with
          must be in the body.</li>
        <li>Three elements common in a head element is the charset, or character set which sets our character encoding.
          Http-equiv elements sets an HTTP header for content. The viewport sets the default view for our webpage. The
          title is what the user will see in the tab at the top of the screen.</li>
        <li>The body element is a semantic element. The name of the element describes its content and the role it plays
          on the webpage. Semantic elements make our code easier to read and accessible to users. The div element is not
          a semantic element.</li>
        <li>h1, h2, h3, and so on represent the level of heading a given text block represent. H1 will be the largest
          text.</li>
        <li>ul, ol, and li, represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items (bullet points)</li>
        <li>The img element contains information about the images the are displayed. The src is the most important. It
          defines the location, or source of the image file.</li>
        <li>The alt attribute will be an alternative name for an image if it doesn't load on your webpage.</li>
        <li>br element creates a line of empty space</li>
        <li>the &lt;a&gt; link, or anchor, creates link to webpages. Href attribute point to the URL for the link</li>
        <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page usually containing other, copyright, etc.</li>
        <li>Make sure to check your code often to catch bugs, or defaults/mistakes in your code. This can be as simply
          as reloading your page.</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are child child elements. The body is the parent element to everything
          inside it.</li>
          <li>Section elements define a section in our document that contains thematic content. They help organzie the page</li>

        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      </ul>
